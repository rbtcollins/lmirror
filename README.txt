What is LMirror
===============

LMirror is a large scale mirroring program. lmirror is targeted at mirrors of
free software projects and other mostly-write-once environments. It has
specific support for barriers in its operations to permit the preservation of
semantic structure on disk during the mirroring process and handles 1:N
and 1:N:M mirroring situations with aplomb.
