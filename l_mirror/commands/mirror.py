    Takes the mirror to mirror from, and the mirror to mirror too. If the
    target does not exist it will be populated from the source mirror.
    
    For example:
    
      $ lmirror mirror http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu /srv/ubuntu

    will initialise a mirror set called ubuntu in /srv/ubuntu, with 
    http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ as a known sender.
    
    Mirroring will not generally copy content already present, but the first
    mirror run can still take considerable time. Subsequent runs should be
    extremely fast.
