"""'Commands' for lmirror.

The code in this module contains the Command base class, which provides stock
UI agnostic support for commands - top level actions that users take.

Actual commands can be found in l_mirror.commands.$commandname.

For example, l_mirror.commands.init is the init command name, and 
l_mirror.command.foo_bar would be the foo-bar command (if one
existed). The Command discovery logic looks for a class in the module with
the same name - e.g. l_mirro.commands.init.init would be the class.
That class must obey the l_mirror.commands.Command protocol, but does
not need to be a subclass.

Plugins and extensions wanting to add commands should install them into
l_mirror.commands (perhaps by extending the l_mirror.commands
__path__ to include a directory containing their commands - no __init__ is
needed in that directory.)

        the UI layer.
    :ivar input_streams: A list of stream specifications. Mandatory streams
        are specified by a simple name. Optional streams are specified by
        a simple name with a ? ending the name. Optional multiple streams are
        specified by a simple name with a * ending the name, and mandatory
        multiple streams by ending the name with +. Multiple streams are used
        when a command can process more than one stream.
