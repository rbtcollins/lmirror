"""In l_mirror a UI is an interface to a 'user' (which may be a machine).

The l_mirror.ui.cli module contains a command line interface, and the
module l_mirror.ui.model contains a purely object based implementation
which is used for testing l_mirror.

See AbstractUI for details on what UI classes should do and are responsible
for.

class AbstractUI(object):
    """The base class for UI objects, this providers helpers and the interface.

    A UI object is responsible for brokering interactions with a particular
    user environment (e.g. the command line). These interactions can take
    several forms:
     - reading bulk data
     - gathering data
     - emitting progress or activity data - hints as to the programs execution.
     - providing notices about actions taken
     - showing the result of some query (including errors)
    All of these things are done in a structured fashion. See the methods
    iter_streams, query_user, progress, notice and result.

    UI objects are generally expected to be used once, with a fresh one
    created for each command executed.

    :ivar cmd: The command that is running using this UI object.
    :ivar here: The location that command is being run in. This may be a local
        path or a URL. This is only guaranteed to be set after set_command is
        called, as some UI's need to do option processing to determine its
        value.
    :ivar options: The parsed options for this ui, containing both global and
        command specific options.
    :ivar arguments: The parsed arguments for this ui. Set Command.args to
        define the accepted arguments for a command.
